# chatbot

Hello all, as part of my 2017 coding challenge, I decided to create my personal assistant chat bot. Although this chat bot is implemented for personal use, I will try to create the code as generic as possible so anyone can fork and start building their own chat bot as well.  
For more details about this project (plans and design discussions), please check the [wiki] (https://github.com/davidkwan95/chatbot/wiki/)
